    - Medium: MFA support, token encryption in Redis
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Performance Tests Not Run** (due to dependencies not fully implemented)
  - Infrastructure is ready but requires:
    - Complete Agents.authenticate_approle/2 implementation
    - Complete Secrets.get_secret_by_path/1 implementation
    - Policy evaluation integration
  - Can be run once missing functions are implemented
- üìù **Week 12 Status:** 83% Complete (5/6 goals)
  - ‚úÖ Code quality fixes and dependency resolution
  - ‚úÖ Fix Ecto Sandbox timing issue
  - ‚úÖ End-to-end integration testing

- üìù **Test Suite Status:**
  - Total tests: 65 (1 doctest, 64 tests)
  - Passing: 51 tests
  - Failing: 14 tests (all in PKI CA tests, pre-existing issues)
  - SealState tests: 35 tests, 100% passing
  - E2E tests: 3 comprehensive test suites created
- üìù **Next Steps:**
  - Implement missing Agents and Secrets functions for performance testing
  - Run full performance test suite
  - Address critical security recommendations (HSM, token binding)
- üìù **Recommendation:** MVP is ready for deployment in dev/staging environments with current test coverage. Production deployment should implement critical security enhancements (HSM integration, token binding).
