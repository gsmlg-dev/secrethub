4. **Missing Features (Planned for Phase 2):**
   - Dynamic secret generation (Week 13-14)
   - Lease renewal logic (Week 13-14)
   - Agent connection management actions (disconnect, reconnect, restart)

### Performance Optimizations

  - GenServer-based in-memory cache with TTL
  - Automatic cache expiration and cleanup (60s interval)
  - Cache hit/miss metrics tracking with ETS tables
  - Fallback mode for stale cache when Core unavailable
  - LRU eviction when max cache size reached
  - Configurable TTL, max size, and fallback settings
- ✅ Enhanced Secret Management UI (`apps/secrethub_web/lib/secrethub_web_web/live/secret_management_live.ex`)
  - Integrated real `Secrets.list_secrets()` instead of mock data
  - Integrated real `Policies.list_policies()`
  - Implemented `delete_secret` with proper error handling
  - Display secret metadata (type, status, rotation info)
  - Show policy bindings per secret
  - Dynamic secret status calculation
  - Next rotation calculation based on last rotation + period
- ✅ Policy Management UI (`apps/secrethub_web/lib/secrethub_web_web/live/policy_management_live.ex`, 900+ lines)
  - Comprehensive policy editor with JSON validation
  - Visual editor for secret patterns (add/remove)
  - Operation toggles (read, write, delete, renew)
  - Entity binding management with agent selection
  - Policy testing interface (test access for entity/secret/operation)
  - Live JSON policy document editing
  - Support for allow/deny policies with visual indicators
  - Validation errors display
  - Modal form for create/edit
- ✅ Router configuration
  - Added `/admin/policies` route for policy management
- ✅ Updated AgentChannel
  - Integrated `Secrets.get_secret_for_entity` for policy-aware secret retrieval
  - Enhanced logging for access grants/denials
  - Improved error handling for secret requests
- 📝 **Week 8-9 Status:** 100% Complete
  - Backend foundation for policy-based secret management complete
  - Agent caching layer ready for production
  - UI provides full secret and policy management capabilities
- 📝 **Next Steps:**
  - Build PKI management UI (Engineer 3 - Week 4-5 final task)
  - Move to Week 10-11: Basic Audit Logging

### Architecture Decisions
- Using Elixir umbrella project structure
- PostgreSQL 16 with uuid-ossp and pgcrypto extensions
- mTLS for all Core ↔ Agent communication
- Audit logs use hash chains for tamper-evidence
- Oban for background job processing
