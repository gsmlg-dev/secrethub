- ✅ Comprehensive unit tests for encryption module (34 tests, all passing)
- ✅ Comprehensive unit tests for Shamir module (35 tests, identified implementation bugs)
- ✅ Comprehensive unit tests for SealState GenServer (seal/unseal lifecycle)
- ✅ Fixed database port configuration (4432 → 5432)
- ✅ Created test support infrastructure (DataCase, Ecto Sandbox)
- ✅ **Fixed Shamir implementation!** Refactored to use byte-wise splitting with GF(251)
  - Uses proper field arithmetic (prime 251 for byte range 0-250)
  - Added adjustment_mask to handle bytes 251-255
  - Reduced test failures from 13 → 4 (31/35 tests passing)
  - Version 3 share format with backwards compatibility

### Architecture Decisions
- Using Elixir umbrella project structure
- PostgreSQL 16 with uuid-ossp and pgcrypto extensions
- mTLS for all Core ↔ Agent communication
- Audit logs use hash chains for tamper-evidence
- Oban for background job processing
